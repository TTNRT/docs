# Doing commits

This will give you a perfect and formal way of doing commits to our GitHub Page!

Pleae read it carefuly, as it is very importent for you!

## Intro

Firstly, when you do a file change, whenever it's in a folder or upload, you need to do a commit for a exact reason.
The commit system was introduced by the GitHub developers and many other teams (includes GitLab, etc), that allows members of any repo to view their changes, even if a part needs to be changed.

However, that system is a needed way for our team to get around than typing out the file over again, while this system makes the file upload to the server and starts it's update with: GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Nelefty, Cloudflare, etc.
In fact, other members, including mods and owner/admins can view these file to restore a certain state of the repos code in it!

In this wiki, you will learn about making the commit as neat as it is, so I can read and understand what your message is talking about in natural reasons alone!

## Getting Started

To get started on the commits, first have a look at the sidebar for a page on the commit that you need to make.
Be noted that not all of your text or message is going to fit in it, but also should have at least one of these word in brackets:

`[UPDATE]`

`[EDIT]`

`[UPLOAD]`

`[DELETE]`

`[ADD]`

It may seem a little hard to do so, but it's best to this when your commiting anyway!

***

Here are some examples here:

`[ADD] index.html 1`

`[EDIT] README.md 1 OR [EDIT] README.md, SAMPLE.md 2`

`[UPLOAD] picture.png 1 OR [UPLOAD] pic1.png, pic.png 2`

The other side of it is to, for example, making a `EDIT`, `ADD` or `UPLOAD`, you should use a comma when you use multiple files on them!

That makes it better, plus you should make your message small for us to see correctly.

Also to note to not use no more than the max letters in the message

## Rules

To use commits, you need to use these for the actions on files or folders. It does not matter if you don't want to or not, you have to be reasonable! Otherwise, it will not accepted!

## Other commits

Not really all repo actions will have a requirement for doing commits, but just in case of that, here are some that may be needed, depending on the action you take:

`[ACTION]` -- You are doing a action on the repo

`[BRANCH]` -- Merge a branch

`[OTHER]` -- Type out the action you took. (Ex: Wiki edit, issue, etc)

## Importent

When you are doing a commit message, it is importent to use the listed action(s) you took for each or other files you modfied and others.

In case of that, it helps us track the progress you are doing.
